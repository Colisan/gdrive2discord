**Frictionless integration between Google Drive and Discord, as a service.**

This is a standalone, multiuser web application written in go, detecting changes on Google Drive files and sending **webhook** notifications to Discord.

So users can easily follow what happens when someone **creates**, **changes**, **shares** and **deletes** documents in their (shared) folders, like this:
